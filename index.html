            <h2>Welcome to my portfolio!</h2>
            <p>This includes videos and pictures of my years as an opera singer, and the new journey I am embarking on with coding, as well as documentation from my everyday life.</p>
            <h3>It is my purpose that this website showcases all the things I am proud of so far, from music to painting to coding.</h3>
            <p>I often forget to be proud of what I have accomplished and where I have been. Since graduating high school, I have completely changed, much like everyone my age. I have moved across the country, lost and discovered passions, and started planning for the future in a whole new way. Suddenly, I found it hard to recognize myself from two years ago. It is now my goal to put it all in one place, the pictures, the videos, the art, and the people. This website is a window into my life, a celebration of who I am, a promise for a happy future for everyone and myself.</p>
            <p>This website contains a page about me, a page about my experiences, a personal reflection page, and a contact page.</p>
