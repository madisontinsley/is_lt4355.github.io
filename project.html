  <li>Music: Various videos of me singing throughout the years, but no more than 4
  videos. Information on the songs and composers will be included. I have been in the ACDA National Honor Choir, multiple district choirs, 4
  musicals, 1 opera, and other musical projects I will have small descriptions
  for.</li>
 <li>Art:
  Art a replacement for music when I was not in a safe music environment. I
  am not even a good artist, but it is a activity I enjoy to share with others, I
  have a no more than 4 pictures of some, and some of the art I am inspired
  by, as I am an art history nerd </li>
  <li>Coding and programming:
  This one I am still fleshing out, probably some links to projects, most of my
  coding is done in python, but I know enough Java to “translate” some
  products into the HTML.
  I am also going to talk about my job at the ACT center, and website
  accessibility.</li>
