       <h2>My Journey</h2>

        <p class="p1">
            My mother says I sang before I could talk. While that could be an exaggeration, I do know I have been singing for a long time.
            My parents have countless videos of me over the years, singing with a CD player covered in pink
            and purple flowers; singing every single word of the 2004 movie adaptation of the Phantom of the Opera; singing solos in front
            of judges in a long black dress. I feel as though I create life when I sing, and I followed music like a moth to the
            flame.
        </p>
        <p class="p2">
            I mentioned on the home page of this website that I find it difficult to recognize
    myself form two years ago, this was when I was a freshmen in college at Pepperdine
    University. I was an aspiring opera singer, going to a reputable music school and trying
    desperately not to complain about having an entire year online. I realize now that I was
    clinging to music as a way to avoid something that scares me: I had no idea who I was.
    Compared to now, where I only know what I am not, but there are no limits as to who I
    am.
        </p>
        <p class="p3">
            My decision to quit music became from reasons I never thought of. The music
    department at Pepperdine University prides itself on being a “family” a concept that
    sounds good on paper, but in reality creates a toxic environment that few can grow in. I
    got the brunt of this toxicity as soon as I was labelled the outcast. Music from that point
    forward became miserable for me, and it took me almost six months to begin singing. 
    Once I quit music, I realized that my voice is the mostprecious posession to me. 
    1I have to decide when I share it, why I share it and that I enjoy sharing it.
        </p>

        <p class="p4">
            Now, I have found more passions than just music. I have found a love for
    painting, art history, and most importantly, coding and technology. I grew up mostly an
    only child, and with this, a love for video games, as I only had myself to entertain. As I
    sat down to decide what was next after Pepperdine, I decided to dissect everything I
    have ever loved, seeing if any sparks turned into more. Technology was that for me,
    something that is much more creative than meets the eye.
